    aboutme: "My name is Ben Mallar I am 23 years old. To get into coding I enrolled in a 12 week fast paced and intense full stack web development bootcamp at Northwestern. Devoting myself to this bootcamp made me fluent in many coding languages, it also made my problem solving and debugging skills prominent. Initally my goal for learning code was to get a high paying job, but every week of endless hours put in, I got more and more hooked. I started really enjoying it, while learning it at the same time, it made me realize more and more daily thingd people use is coded. I want to help make peoples lives easier with new and improved user friendly UX. I genuinely enjoy doing this and getting to work with others who think the same would be a dream.",
